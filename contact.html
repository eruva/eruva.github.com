      <p>
        We'd love to talk to you about your project! We're always looking for great ideas to be a part of
        and we want to make your project or prototype come alive!
      </p>
      <p>
        We're experts in Ruby on Rails and love to work with that framework. If you're looking for someone
        to manage a PHP or Wordpress project, we're probably not your best bet.

      <h3>Ask yourself a few questions</h3>
      <p>
        The more you know about your product, the faster it is to get started.
        Here's a few questions you might want to ask yourself about your project:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>In 50 words or less, describe your product. What's the "elevator pitch"?</li>
        <li>What's your budget?</li>
        <li>Do you have any deadlines?</li>
        <li>Who are the users of your product? It's always good to have an "archetype" in mind before beginning.</li>
        <li>Do you plan to make money from this web app? If so, how?</li>
      </ul>
