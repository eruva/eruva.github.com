      <h2>The way we do it</h2>
      <p>
        We take an "inside-out" approach to design and development. What is it you want to accomplish with your app? What value does it
        bring to the user? Once we've got that nailed down, then we move to design and implementation. We help you stay focused on the big
        idea and we work our best to get you to market fast. Then, we gather feedback from your users and iterate quickly to make your
        product the best it can be.
      </p>
      <p>
        Our team uses the Ruby on Rails web application framework to develop websites. Rails is known for allowing developers to iterate quickly on
        new ideas and concepts.
      </p>
      <h2>Small Team (on purpose)</h2>
      <p>
        Eruva is a small shop devoted to your happiness and to the success of your product. We keep it small on purpose -- to keep our focus on you.
