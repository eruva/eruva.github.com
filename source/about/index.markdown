# About

## Our Story

Eruva was created in 2012 as a consulting and development shop. We're a tiny little shop by the beach in San Diego. We love to make web apps built on Ruby on Rails.

If you're looking for a quality web app and want to work with quality people, [give us a holler][1].


## Who We Are

We're a husband and wife team: Jon & Erin McCartie.  You can find us both on Twitter: [@jmccartie][2] and [@emccartie][3].

A few sites Jon has worked on in the past:

* [Planning Center Online](http://get.planningcenteronline.com)
* [LifeChurch.tv](http://www.lifechurch.tv)
* [ChurchMetrics](http://www.churchmetrics.com)
* [OPEN](http://open.lifechurch.tv)
* [Chazown](http://www.chazown.com)

For sites and products directly built by Eruva, visit our [Products page][4].
